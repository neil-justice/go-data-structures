# DSA

Implementations of varipus basic data structures and algorithms in Golang done as part of learning the language.

Includes:
* linked list
* stack
* queue
* priority queue
* merge sort
* quick sort
* tree sort
* binary search tree
* tree set
* min heap
* max heap

## TODO

* Most of the implementations take strings or ints - change them to use interfaces (and casts, unfortunately... - no generics in go)
* Make the binary search tree (configurably) support duplicates so that the tree sort doesn't drop them
